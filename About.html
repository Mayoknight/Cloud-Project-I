                    Hallo Numele neu Adzfan Alifa Yusuf, Welcome to Porto, This website was built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on backend functionality.
                    In the "Generate Now" section, you can try generating and downloading a custom PDF — give it a try!. 

                    This projects is more than just a website it's my first step toward expanding into future cloud computing projects.

                    I designed and developed this site by combining insights from YouTube tutorials for layout and interactivity, and used ChatGPT to deepen my understanding of each step in the process. 
                    
                    Every line of code here is not just practice it’s a statement of dedication. 

                    This website also stands as proof of my readiness to compete for the MFA Scholarship to Romania, showing that I’m committed, self-driven, and eager to keep growing in the world of tech.
